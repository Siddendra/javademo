Wikipedia defines Chain of Responsibility as a design pattern consisting of “a source of command objects and a series of processing objects”.

Each processing object in the chain is responsible for a certain type of command, and the processing is done, it forwards the command to the next processor in the chain.

hain of responsibility pattern is used to achieve loose coupling in software design where a request from the client is passed to a chain of objects to process them.
Later,the object in the chain will decide themselves who will be processing the request and whether the request is required to be sent to the next object in the chain or not.

Where and When Chain of Responsibility pattern is applicable :

When you want to decouple a request’s sender and receiver
Multiple objects, determined at runtime, are candidates to handle a request
When you don’t want to specify handlers explicitly in your code
When you want to issue a request to one of several objects without specifying the receiver explicitly.
This pattern is recommended when multiple objects can handle a request and the handler doesn’t have to be a specific object.
 Also, the handler is determined at runtime. Please note that a request not handled at all by any handler is a valid use case.
